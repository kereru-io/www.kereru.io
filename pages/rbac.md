The Kereru web application was designed with multiple editors in mind. To support this,  role based access control is built in to Kereru.

The first account created on first run is the Kereru administrator. The administrator can create futher accounts and roles.

Kereru is configured by default with a set of roles that are likely to meet the needs of most situations.
